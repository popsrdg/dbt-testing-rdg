using dbt can I show a data flow between multiple external tables.  For example, data from external tables A and B populating external table C and then that External Table C flows into a materialized table in my environment

Yes, you can show a data flow between multiple external tables and a materialized table in your environment using dbt's sources and models features.

First, you would define your external tables as sources in your dbt project, similar to how you would define tables in your database. For example, if you have external tables A and B, you could define them in your sources.yml file like this:


Then, you could define a model that selects data from A and B and inserts it into C, which is also an external table. For example:

Finally, you could define another model that selects data from C and materializes it into a table in your environment. For example:



By defining these models and sources, you can visualize the data flow between A, B, C, and my_materialized_table in dbt's lineage diagram, which you can generate using the dbt lineage command. This diagram will show how data flows from one table to another, as well as any transformations that are applied along the way.
